Formulating **compiler pass search** as a **constrained optimization problem** involves defining an objective function to optimize (e.g., minimizing execution time or code size) and specifying constraints (e.g., memory usage, correctness, or compilation time). Below is a step-by-step guide to formulating this problem:

---

### 1. **Define the Decision Variables**
The decision variables represent the choices you need to make. In compiler pass search, these are typically:
- **Binary variables**: \( x_i \in \{0, 1\} \), where \( x_i = 1 \) if the \( i \)-th compiler pass is applied, and \( x_i = 0 \) otherwise.
- **Ordering variables**: If the order of passes matters, you may need additional variables to represent the sequence of passes.

For simplicity, assume \( x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \) is a vector of binary variables representing whether each of the \( n \) compiler passes is applied.

---

### 2. **Define the Objective Function**
The objective function represents the goal of the optimization. For example:
- **Minimize execution time**: Let \( T(x) \) be the execution time of the compiled program for a given set of passes \( x \). The objective is:
  \[
  \text{Minimize } T(x).
  \]
- **Minimize code size**: Let \( S(x) \) be the size of the compiled program. The objective is:
  \[
  \text{Minimize } S(x).
  \]
- **Multi-objective optimization**: You can combine multiple objectives, e.g., a weighted sum of execution time and code size:
  \[
  \text{Minimize } \alpha T(x) + \beta S(x),
  \]
  where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are weights.

---

### 3. **Define the Constraints**
Constraints represent the limitations or requirements of the problem. For example:
- **Correctness**: The compiled program must produce the correct output. This can be represented as a constraint:
  \[
  C(x) = 1,
  \]
  where \( C(x) = 1 \) if the program is correct, and \( C(x) = 0 \) otherwise.
- **Memory usage**: The memory usage of the compiled program must not exceed a limit \( M_{\text{max}} \):
  \[
  M(x) \leq M_{\text{max}},
  \]
  where \( M(x) \) is the memory usage.
- **Compilation time**: The total compilation time must not exceed a limit \( T_{\text{compile}}^{\text{max}} \):
  \[
  T_{\text{compile}}(x) \leq T_{\text{compile}}^{\text{max}}.
  \]
- **Dependencies between passes**: Some passes may depend on others. For example, if pass \( j \) requires pass \( i \), you can add:
  \[
  x_j \leq x_i.
  \]

---

### 4. **Formulate the Optimization Problem**
Combine the objective function and constraints into a single optimization problem. For example:
\[
\text{Minimize } T(x)
\]
subject to:
\[
C(x) = 1,
\]
\[
M(x) \leq M_{\text{max}},
\]
\[
T_{\text{compile}}(x) \leq T_{\text{compile}}^{\text{max}},
\]
\[
x_j \leq x_i \quad \text{(for dependent passes)},
\]
\[
x_i \in \{0, 1\} \quad \text{for all } i.
\]

---

### 5. **Challenges in Formulation**
- **Non-linearity**: The objective function \( T(x) \) and constraints \( C(x) \), \( M(x) \), and \( T_{\text{compile}}(x) \) are often non-linear and difficult to model analytically.
- **Discrete nature**: The problem is combinatorial, as \( x \) is a binary vector. This makes it a **mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)** problem, which is NP-hard in general.
- **Evaluation cost**: Evaluating \( T(x) \), \( C(x) \), etc., typically requires running the compiler and executing the program, which can be computationally expensive.

---

### 6. **Solving the Problem**
Given the complexity of the problem, traditional optimization methods (e.g., gradient-based or KKT-based approaches) are often impractical. Instead, heuristic or machine learning-based methods are commonly used:
- **Reinforcement learning (RL)**: Treat the compiler pass selection as a sequential decision-making problem, where the RL agent learns a policy to select passes that optimize the objective while satisfying constraints.
- **Genetic algorithms**: Use evolutionary methods to explore the space of possible pass sequences.
- **Simulated annealing**: A probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum.
- **Constraint programming**: Use specialized solvers for combinatorial optimization problems with constraints.

---

### Example Formulation
Suppose you want to minimize execution time \( T(x) \) while ensuring correctness \( C(x) = 1 \) and limiting memory usage \( M(x) \leq M_{\text{max}} \). The optimization problem is:
\[
\text{Minimize } T(x)
\]
subject to:
\[
C(x) = 1,
\]
\[
M(x) \leq M_{\text{max}},
\]
\[
x_i \in \{0, 1\} \quad \text{for all } i.
\]

---

### Summary
Formulating compiler pass search as a constrained optimization problem involves defining decision variables, an objective function, and constraints. However, due to the problem's combinatorial and non-linear nature, traditional optimization methods are often impractical, and heuristic or learning-based approaches like RL are typically used instead.
