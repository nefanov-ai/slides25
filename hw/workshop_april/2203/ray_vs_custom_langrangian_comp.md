Yes, **Constrained PPO (CPPO)** from **Ray RLlib** works similarly to the **PPO-Lagrangian** implementation described above. Both approaches use **Lagrangian multipliers** to handle constraints in reinforcement learning tasks. However, there are some differences in implementation details and features between the two.

Below, I’ll explain how **Constrained PPO in Ray RLlib** works and compare it to the custom **PPO-Lagrangian** implementation.

### How Constrained PPO in Ray RLlib Works

Ray RLlib’s **Constrained PPO** is an implementation of the PPO algorithm with support for constrained optimization. It uses Lagrangian multipliers to enforce constraints during training. Here’s how it works:

#### 1. **Constraint Definition**
   - Constraints are defined as cost functions \( c(s_t, a_t) \).
   - The goal is to keep the expected cumulative cost below a specified limit \( C \):
     \[
     \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T c(s_t, a_t) \right] \leq C
     \]

#### 2. **Lagrangian Multiplier**
   - A Lagrangian multiplier \( \lambda \) is introduced to penalize constraint violations.
   - The augmented loss function becomes:
     \[
     L(\theta) = L_{\text{PPO}}(\theta) - \lambda \left( \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T c(s_t, a_t) \right] - C \right)
     \]
   - The multiplier \( \lambda \) is updated iteratively during training to balance reward and constraint satisfaction.

#### 3. **Training Process**
   - The agent collects trajectories using the current policy.
   - The policy is updated using the PPO loss, augmented with the Lagrangian term.
   - The Lagrangian multiplier is updated based on the constraint violation.

#### 4. **Configuration**
   - In Ray RLlib, constraints are configured using the `constraints` parameter in the `PPOConfig`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     config = (
         PPOConfig()
         .environment("YourEnv")
         .constraints(
             constraints={
                 "cost_constraint": (0.0, 1.0)  # Define your constraint here
             }
         )
     )
     ```

### Comparison: Ray RLlib Constrained PPO vs. Custom PPO-Lagrangian

| Feature/Aspect               | Ray RLlib Constrained PPO                          | Custom PPO-Lagrangian Implementation              |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

| **Ease of Use**               | Easy to use with Ray RLlib’s high-level API.      | Requires more effort to implement and debug.     |
| **Flexibility**               | Limited to Ray RLlib’s framework and features.    | Fully customizable to specific needs.            |
| **Scalability**               | Designed for distributed training (Ray backend).  | Scalability depends on implementation.           |
| **Documentation**             | Well-documented in Ray RLlib’s official docs.     | Requires custom documentation.                   |

### Key Similarities

1. **Lagrangian Approach**:
   - Both methods use Lagrangian multipliers to handle constraints.
   - The multiplier is updated iteratively based on constraint violations.

2. **Augmented Loss Function**:
   - Both methods modify the PPO loss function to include a Lagrangian term.

3. **Constraint Satisfaction**:
   - Both methods aim to maximize reward while keeping the expected cumulative cost below a specified limit.

---

### Key Differences

1. **Implementation**:
   - Ray RLlib’s Constrained PPO is a built-in feature, while the custom PPO-Lagrangian requires manual implementation.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Ray RLlib allows constraints to be configured via a high-level API, whereas the custom implementation requires explicit coding of the cost function and multiplier update logic.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Ray RLlib is designed for distributed training, making it more scalable for large-scale problems.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - The custom implementation is more flexible, as you can tailor it to specific needs (e.g., custom cost functions, multiplier update rules).

### Example: Ray RLlib Constrained PPO

Here’s an example of how to use **Constrained PPO** in Ray RLlib:

```python
from ray import tune
from ray.rllib.algorithms.ppo import PPOConfig

# Define the environment and constraints
config = (
    PPOConfig()
    .environment("YourEnv")
    .framework("torch")
    .constraints(
        constraints={
            "cost_constraint": (0.0, 1.0)  # Define your constraint here
        }
    )
    .training(
        gamma=0.99,
        lr=3e-4,
        train_batch_size=4000,
        sgd_minibatch_size=128,
        num_sgd_iter=10,
        model={"fcnet_hiddens": [128, 128]},
    )
)

# Train the agent
tune.run(
    "PPO",
    config=config.to_dict(),
    stop={"timesteps_total": 100000},
    checkpoint_at_end=True,
)
```

### Example: Custom PPO-Lagrangian

Here’s an example of a custom **PPO-Lagrangian** implementation:

```python
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
import torch

class PPOLagrangian(PPO):
    def __init__(self, *args, cost_limit=0.0, lagrangian_multiplier_init=0.1, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.cost_limit = cost_limit
        self.lagrangian_multiplier = torch.tensor(lagrangian_multiplier_init, requires_grad=True, device=self.device)

    def compute_loss(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Compute the standard PPO loss
        loss = super().compute_loss(*args, **kwargs)

        # Compute the cost (constraint violation)
        cost = self.compute_cost(*args, **kwargs)

        # Add the Lagrangian term to the loss
        lagrangian_loss = self.lagrangian_multiplier * (cost - self.cost_limit)
        loss += lagrangian_loss

        return loss

    def compute_cost(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Define your cost function here (e.g., runtime constraint violation)
        raise NotImplementedError("You need to implement the cost function.")

    def update_lagrangian_multiplier(self, cost):
        # Update the Lagrangian multiplier based on constraint violation
        self.lagrangian_multiplier += self.lr * (cost - self.cost_limit)
        self.lagrangian_multiplier = torch.clamp(self.lagrangian_multiplier, min=0.0)

# Use the custom PPOLagrangian in your code
model = PPOLagrangian(
    "MlpPolicy",
    env,
    verbose=1,
    cost_limit=0.0,  # Set your cost limit here
    lagrangian_multiplier_init=0.1,  # Initial value for the Lagrangian multiplier
)

# Train the agent
model.learn(total_timesteps=100000)
```

### Conclusion

- Ray RLlib’s implementation is easier to use and more scalable, while a custom implementation offers greater flexibility.
- If you’re already using Ray RLlib, its Constrained PPO is a great choice. If you need more control or are working outside the Ray ecosystem, a custom implementation may be preferable.
