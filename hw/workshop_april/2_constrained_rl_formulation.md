Formulating **compiler pass search** as a **constrained reinforcement learning (RL)** problem involves defining the RL components (states, actions, rewards, and constraints) in a way that aligns with the optimization goals and constraints of the compiler pass selection task. Below is a step-by-step guide to formulating this problem:

---

### 1. **Define the Components of the RL Problem**

#### **State Space (\( \mathcal{S} \))**
The state represents the current configuration of the compilation process. It could include:
- The current sequence of applied compiler passes.
- Features of the intermediate representation (IR) of the program (e.g., size, complexity, or performance metrics).
- Historical information about the effects of previously applied passes.

For example:
\[
s_t = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{t-1}, \text{IR features}),
\]
where \( x_i \in \{0, 1\} \) indicates whether the \( i \)-th pass has been applied.

#### **Action Space (\( \mathcal{A} \))**
The action represents the choice of the next compiler pass to apply. It could be:
- A discrete action: \( a_t \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\} \), where \( n \) is the total number of available passes.
- A binary action: \( a_t \in \{0, 1\} \), where \( 0 \) means "do not apply the next pass" and \( 1 \) means "apply the next pass."

#### **Reward Function (\( R \))**
The reward function guides the RL agent toward the optimization goal. For example:
- **Minimize execution time**: The reward could be the negative execution time of the compiled program:
  \[
  R(s_t, a_t) = -T(s_t, a_t),
  \]
  where \( T(s_t, a_t) \) is the execution time after applying the chosen pass.
- **Minimize code size**: The reward could be the negative code size:
  \[
  R(s_t, a_t) = -S(s_t, a_t),
  \]
  where \( S(s_t, a_t) \) is the code size after applying the chosen pass.
- **Multi-objective reward**: Combine multiple objectives, e.g., a weighted sum of execution time and code size:
  \[
  R(s_t, a_t) = -\left( \alpha T(s_t, a_t) + \beta S(s_t, a_t) \right),
  \]
  where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are weights.

#### **Transition Dynamics (\( P \))**
The transition dynamics describe how the state evolves after taking an action. In compiler pass search:
- Applying a pass modifies the IR of the program, leading to a new state \( s_{t+1} \).
- The transition is deterministic if the effect of each pass is predictable, or stochastic if there is uncertainty.

### 2. **Define the Constraints**
Constraints represent the limitations or requirements of the problem. In constrained RL, constraints are typically modeled as **cost functions** that the agent must satisfy. For example:
- **Correctness**: The compiled program must produce the correct output. Define a cost function \( C(s_t, a_t) \) such that:
  \[
  C(s_t, a_t) = 0 \quad \text{if the program is correct, else } 1.
  \]
  The constraint is:
  \[
  \sum_{t=1}^T C(s_t, a_t) = 0.
  \]
- **Memory usage**: The memory usage of the compiled program must not exceed a limit \( M_{\text{max}} \). Define a cost function:
  \[
  M(s_t, a_t) = \text{memory usage after applying the pass}.
  \]
  The constraint is:
  \[
  \sum_{t=1}^T M(s_t, a_t) \leq M_{\text{max}}.
  \]
- **Compilation time**: The total compilation time must not exceed a limit \( T_{\text{compile}}^{\text{max}} \). Define a cost function:
  \[
  T_{\text{compile}}(s_t, a_t) = \text{time taken to apply the pass}.
  \]
  The constraint is:
  \[
  \sum_{t=1}^T T_{\text{compile}}(s_t, a_t) \leq T_{\text{compile}}^{\text{max}}.
  \]

### 3. **Formulate the Constrained RL Problem**
The goal of constrained RL is to maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying the constraints. The problem can be formulated as:
\[
\text{Maximize } \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T R(s_t, a_t) \right]
\]
subject to:
\[
\mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T C(s_t, a_t) \right] = 0,
\]
\[
\mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T M(s_t, a_t) \right] \leq M_{\text{max}}},
\]
\[
\mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T T_{\text{compile}}(s_t, a_t) \right] \leq T_{\text{compile}}^{\text{max}}.
\]

---

### 4. **Solving the Constrained RL Problem**
Constrained RL problems can be solved using specialized algorithms, such as:
- **Lagrangian Methods**: Introduce Lagrange multipliers to incorporate constraints into the reward function, transforming the problem into an unconstrained one.
- **Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO)**: A policy gradient method that directly optimizes the policy while ensuring constraint satisfaction.
- **Reward Shaping**: Modify the reward function to penalize constraint violations.

---

### Example Formulation
Suppose you want to minimize execution time \( T(s_t, a_t) \) while ensuring correctness \( C(s_t, a_t) = 0 \) and limiting memory usage \( M(s_t, a_t) \leq M_{\text{max}} \). The constrained RL problem is:
\[
\text{Maximize } \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T -T(s_t, a_t) \right]
\]
subject to:
\[
\mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T C(s_t, a_t) \right] = 0,
\]
\[
\mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^T M(s_t, a_t) \right] \leq M_{\text{max}}}.
\]

---

### Summary
Formulating compiler pass search as a constrained RL problem involves defining the state space, action space, reward function, and constraints. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward (e.g., minimize execution time) while satisfying constraints (e.g., correctness and memory usage). Specialized constrained RL algorithms can then be used to solve the problem.
