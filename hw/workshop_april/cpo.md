To use **Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO)** with the `CompilerPassOrderingEnv` environment and enforce **constraints**, we need to explicitly define the constraints in the environment and ensure that the CPO algorithm optimizes the policy while respecting these constraints. Below, I'll explain how to modify the environment and CPO setup to handle constraints effectively.

### Key Steps to Use CPO with Constraints

1. **Define Constraints in the Environment**:
   - Modify the environment to return constraint values (e.g., memory usage, correctness) in the `info` dictionary.

2. **Use a CPO Implementation**:
   - Use a CPO implementation that supports constrained optimization (e.g., `safety-starter-agents`).

3. **Configure CPO for Constraints**:
   - Specify the constraint limits and ensure the CPO algorithm optimizes the policy while keeping the constraints below these limits.

### Updated Code for CPO with Constraints

Below is the updated code to use CPO with constraints in the `CompilerPassOrderingEnv`.

#### 1. Modify the Environment to Return Constraints
Update the `_calculate_reward_and_constraints` method to return constraint values explicitly.

```python
def _calculate_reward_and_constraints(self):
    """Calculate reward, constraints, and termination condition."""
    # Apply the pass sequence to the LLVM IR
    optimized_ir = self._apply_passes(self.program_ir, self.pass_sequence)

    # Simulate the effects of the optimized IR
    execution_time = self._simulate_execution_time(optimized_ir)
    memory_usage = self._simulate_memory_usage(optimized_ir)
    is_correct = self._simulate_correctness(optimized_ir)

    # Reward: Minimize execution time (negative reward)
    reward = -execution_time

    # Constraints
    memory_limit = 100  # Example memory limit
    memory_violation = max(0, memory_usage - memory_limit)
    correctness_violation = 0 if is_correct else 1

    # Check if constraints are violated
    constraints_satisfied = (memory_violation == 0) and (correctness_violation == 0)

    # Done condition: Maximum steps reached or constraints violated
    done = (self.current_step >= self.max_steps) or not constraints_satisfied

    # Additional info
    info = {
        "execution_time": execution_time,
        "memory_usage": memory_usage,
        "is_correct": is_correct,
        "constraints": {
            "memory_violation": memory_violation,
            "correctness_violation": correctness_violation
        }
    }

    return reward, done, info
```

#### 2. Use CPO with Constraints
Use the `safety-starter-agents` library to configure CPO for constrained optimization.

```python
from safety_starter_agents import CPO
from stable_baselines3.common.env_util import make_vec_env

# Define environment parameters
num_passes = 10  # Number of available compiler passes
max_steps = 5    # Maximum number of passes to apply
program_ir = """define i32 @main() {
    ret i32 0
}"""  # Example LLVM IR

# Create the environment
env = CompilerPassOrderingEnv(num_passes, max_steps, program_ir)

# Wrap the environment for vectorized training
env = make_vec_env(lambda: env, n_envs=1)

# Initialize CPO with constraints
model = CPO(
    "MlpPolicy",
    env,
    verbose=1,
    constraint_limit=0.0,  # Constraint limit (e.g., no violations allowed)
    constraint_dim=2,      # Number of constraints (memory_violation, correctness_violation)
    gamma=0.99,            # Discount factor
    lam=0.95               # Lambda for GAE
)

# Train the policy
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

# Save the model
model.save("cpo_compiler_pass_ordering_constrained")
```

---

#### 3. Evaluate the Policy
After training, evaluate the policy to ensure it respects the constraints.

```python
# Load the trained model
model = CPO.load("cpo_compiler_pass_ordering_constrained")

# Evaluate the policy
obs = env.reset()
for _ in range(max_steps):
    action, _ = model.predict(obs)
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    print(f"Action: {action}, Reward: {reward}, Done: {done}, Info: {info}")
    if done:
        break
```

---

### Explanation of Key Changes

1. **Constraint Definition**:
   - The environment now returns two constraints in the `info` dictionary:
     - `memory_violation`: The amount by which memory usage exceeds the limit.
     - `correctness_violation`: A binary value indicating whether the program is incorrect.

2. **CPO Configuration**:
   - `constraint_limit=0.0`: Ensures that the constraints (memory and correctness violations) are not allowed to exceed 0.
   - `constraint_dim=2`: Specifies that there are two constraints to enforce.

3. **Training**:
   - The CPO algorithm optimizes the policy to maximize reward while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.

### Example Output During Training
```
| rollout/           |          |
|    ep_len_mean     | 5        |
|    ep_rew_mean     | -0.12    |
|    constraints     | 0.0      |
|    memory_violation| 0.0      |
|    correctness_viol| 0.0      |
```

### Summary

This implementation integrates CPO with the `CompilerPassOrderingEnv` and enforces constraints on memory usage and correctness. The environment explicitly returns constraint values, and CPO is configured to optimize the policy while respecting these constraints. You can extend this by adding more constraints or refining the LLVM pass interactions.
