Automating the process of experimenting with different LLVM pass combinations and orders involves creating a script that systematically applies various pass configurations, measures their performance, and selects the best one. Below is an example of how you can automate this process using Python and the `subprocess` module to interact with LLVM tools.

---

### Step 1: Define the Pass Combinations
Create a list of pass combinations to test. Each combination is a list of LLVM pass names.

```python
pass_combinations = [
    ["-mem2reg", "-instcombine", "-simplifycfg", "-gvn", "-licm", "-loop-unroll", "-slp-vectorizer", "-adce"],
    ["-mem2reg", "-instcombine", "-simplifycfg", "-gvn", "-licm", "-loop-unroll", "-slp-vectorizer", "-adce", "-loop-vectorize"],
    ["-mem2reg", "-instcombine", "-simplifycfg", "-gvn", "-licm", "-loop-unroll", "-slp-vectorizer", "-adce", "-early-cse"],
    ["-mem2reg", "-instcombine", "-simplifycfg", "-gvn", "-licm", "-loop-unroll", "-slp-vectorizer", "-adce", "-loop-vectorize", "-early-cse"],
    # Add more combinations as needed
]
```

---

### Step 2: Write the Automation Script
The script will:
1. Apply each pass combination to the input LLVM IR file.
2. Generate an optimized IR file.
3. Compile the optimized IR to a binary.
4. Measure the performance of the binary.
5. Record the results and select the best configuration.

```python
import subprocess
import time

def run_opt(input_ir, output_ir, passes):
    """Run LLVM's opt tool with the given passes."""
    cmd = ["opt", input_ir] + passes + ["-o", output_ir]
    subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)

def compile_ir_to_binary(input_ir, output_bin):
    """Compile LLVM IR to a binary using clang."""
    cmd = ["clang", input_ir, "-o", output_bin]
    subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)

def measure_performance(binary):
    """Measure the performance of the binary."""
    start_time = time.time()
    subprocess.run([binary], check=True)
    end_time = time.time()
    return end_time - start_time

def main():
    input_ir = "input.ll"  # Input LLVM IR file
    best_time = float("inf")
    best_passes = []

    for i, passes in enumerate(pass_combinations):
        print(f"Testing pass combination {i + 1}: {passes}")

        # Apply passes and generate optimized IR
        optimized_ir = f"optimized_{i}.ll"
        run_opt(input_ir, optimized_ir, passes)

        # Compile optimized IR to a binary
        binary = f"binary_{i}"
        compile_ir_to_binary(optimized_ir, binary)

        # Measure performance
        execution_time = measure_performance(f"./{binary}")
        print(f"Execution time: {execution_time:.4f} seconds")

        # Update the best configuration
        if execution_time < best_time:
            best_time = execution_time
            best_passes = passes

    print(f"\nBest pass combination: {best_passes}")
    print(f"Best execution time: {best_time:.4f} seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 3: Prepare the Input LLVM IR
Ensure you have an LLVM IR file (`input.ll`) to optimize. You can generate this file from a C/C++ program using Clang:

```bash
clang -S -emit-llvm -o input.ll input.c
```

---

### Step 4: Run the Automation Script
Run the script to test all pass combinations and find the best one:

```bash
python automate_optimization.py
```

---

### Step 5: Analyze the Results
The script will output the best pass combination and its corresponding execution time. You can use this information to fine-tune your optimization pipeline further.

---

### Example Output
```
Testing pass combination 1: ['-mem2reg', '-instcombine', '-simplifycfg', '-gvn', '-licm', '-loop-unroll', '-slp-vectorizer', '-adce']
Execution time: 1.2345 seconds

Testing pass combination 2: ['-mem2reg', '-instcombine', '-simplifycfg', '-gvn', '-licm', '-loop-unroll', '-slp-vectorizer', '-adce', '-loop-vectorize']
Execution time: 1.1234 seconds

Testing pass combination 3: ['-mem2reg', '-instcombine', '-simplifycfg', '-gvn', '-licm', '-loop-unroll', '-slp-vectorizer', '-adce', '-early-cse']
Execution time: 1.3456 seconds

Testing pass combination 4: ['-mem2reg', '-instcombine', '-simplifycfg', '-gvn', '-licm', '-loop-unroll', '-slp-vectorizer', '-adce', '-loop-vectorize', '-early-cse']
Execution time: 1.1111 seconds

Best pass combination: ['-mem2reg', '-instcombine', '-simplifycfg', '-gvn', '-licm', '-loop-unroll', '-slp-vectorizer', '-adce', '-loop-vectorize', '-early-cse']
Best execution time: 1.1111 seconds
```

---

### Step 6: Extend the Script
To make the script more robust, you can:
1. Add more pass combinations to test.
2. Use statistical methods to measure performance (e.g., run the binary multiple times and take the average).
3. Integrate with benchmarking tools like `perf` for more detailed performance metrics.
4. Save the results to a file for further analysis.

---

### Conclusion
This script automates the process of experimenting with different LLVM pass combinations to find the best optimization configuration for your program. By systematically testing and measuring performance, you can identify the most effective optimizations for your specific workload.
