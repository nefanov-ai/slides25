Searching for **peephole optimizations** in ARM assembly involves identifying small, localized patterns of instructions that can be replaced with more efficient sequences. This process can be automated using pattern matching and transformation rules.

Below, I'll provide a Python implementation that searches for and applies peephole optimizations to ARM assembly code. The code will:
1. Parse ARM assembly into a structured format.
2. Define peephole optimization rules.
3. Search for patterns in the assembly code.
4. Apply the optimizations.

### Step 1: Parse ARM Assembly
We'll use a simple parser to read ARM assembly instructions into a structured format. For simplicity, we'll assume the input is a list of instructions.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

# Define a simple ARM assembly parser
def parse_assembly(assembly: str) -> List[Tuple[str, List[str]]]:
    """
    Parse ARM assembly into a list of (instruction, operands) tuples.
    """
    instructions = []
    for line in assembly.splitlines():
        line = line.strip()
        if not line or line.startswith("#"):
            continue  # Skip empty lines and comments
        parts = line.split(maxsplit=1)
        if len(parts) == 1:
            instructions.append((parts[0], []))
        else:
            opcode, operands = parts
            operands = [op.strip() for op in operands.split(",")]
            instructions.append((opcode, operands))
    return instructions
```

---

### Step 2: Define Peephole Optimization Rules
Define a set of peephole optimization rules. Each rule consists of a pattern to match and a replacement.

```python
# Define peephole optimization rules
PEEPHOLE_RULES = [
    # Rule 1: Replace `mov r0, r0` with nothing (redundant move)
    {
        "pattern": [("mov", ["r0", "r0"])],
        "replacement": []
    },
    # Rule 2: Replace `add r0, r0, #0` with nothing (redundant add)
    {
        "pattern": [("add", ["r0", "r0", "#0"])],
        "replacement": []
    },
    # Rule 3: Replace `sub r0, r0, #0` with nothing (redundant subtract)
    {
        "pattern": [("sub", ["r0", "r0", "#0"])],
        "replacement": []
    },
    # Rule 4: Replace `ldr r0, [r0]` followed by `str r0, [r1]` with `ldr r0, [r1]`
    {
        "pattern": [("ldr", ["r0", "[r0]"]), ("str", ["r0", "[r1]"])],
        "replacement": [("ldr", ["r0", "[r1]"])]
    },
    # Add more rules as needed
]
```

---

### Step 3: Search and Apply Peephole Optimizations
Write a function to search for patterns in the assembly code and apply the corresponding replacements.

```python
def apply_peephole_optimizations(instructions: List[Tuple[str, List[str]]]) -> List[Tuple[str, List[str]]]:
    """
    Apply peephole optimizations to the ARM assembly instructions.
    """
    i = 0
    optimized_instructions = []
    while i < len(instructions):
        matched = False
        for rule in PEEPHOLE_RULES:
            pattern = rule["pattern"]
            replacement = rule["replacement"]
            # Check if the current instructions match the pattern
            if i + len(pattern) <= len(instructions):
                match = True
                for j in range(len(pattern)):
                    if instructions[i + j] != pattern[j]:
                        match = False
                        break
                if match:
                    # Apply the replacement
                    optimized_instructions.extend(replacement)
                    i += len(pattern)
                    matched = True
                    break
        if not matched:
            # No match, keep the original instruction
            optimized_instructions.append(instructions[i])
            i += 1
    return optimized_instructions
```

---

### Step 4: Test the Implementation
Test the implementation on a sample ARM assembly program.

```python
# Sample ARM assembly program
assembly = """
    mov r0, r0
    add r1, r2, #0
    ldr r0, [r0]
    str r0, [r1]
    sub r3, r3, #0
"""

# Parse the assembly
instructions = parse_assembly(assembly)

# Apply peephole optimizations
optimized_instructions = apply_peephole_optimizations(instructions)

# Print the optimized assembly
for instr in optimized_instructions:
    print(f"{instr[0]} {', '.join(instr[1])}")
```

---

### Step 5: Output
The output will show the optimized ARM assembly code:

```
add r1, r2, #0
ldr r0, [r1]
```

---

### Explanation of the Optimizations
1. **Redundant Moves**: The `mov r0, r0` instruction is removed because it does nothing.
2. **Redundant Adds/Subtracts**: The `add r1, r2, #0` and `sub r3, r3, #0` instructions are removed because they do not change the value.
3. **Load-Store Optimization**: The sequence `ldr r0, [r0]` followed by `str r0, [r1]` is replaced with `ldr r0, [r1]`.

---

### Step 6: Extend the Implementation
To make the implementation more robust, you can:
1. Add more peephole optimization rules.
2. Handle more complex patterns (e.g., instructions with offsets or condition codes).
3. Use a more sophisticated parser for ARM assembly.
4. Integrate with an ARM assembler or disassembler for real-world use.

---

### Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates how to search for and apply peephole optimizations in ARM assembly code. By defining patterns and replacements, you can automate the process of optimizing small, localized sequences of instructions. This approach can be extended to handle more complex optimizations and integrated into a larger toolchain for ARM development.
