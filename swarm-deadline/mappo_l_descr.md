Yes, the document discusses **MAPPO-L** (Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrangian constraints), which is a safe MARL algorithm that uses a **centralized critic** and incorporates **V-function constraints** to ensure safety. This algorithm is mentioned as one of the baselines compared against the proposed **CS-MADDPG** and **CSQ** algorithms in the experiments.

### Key Features of MAPPO-L:
1. **Centralized Critic**: 
   - MAPPO-L uses a centralized critic to estimate the value function (V-function) for each agent. The centralized critic has access to the global state and the actions of all agents, allowing it to better coordinate and optimize the policies of the agents.
   - The centralized critic helps in reducing the non-stationarity problem in MARL by providing a more stable and accurate estimate of the value function.

2. **V-function Constraints**:
   - MAPPO-L incorporates safety constraints into the value function (V-function) to ensure that the agents' policies adhere to safety requirements. These constraints are typically formulated as part of a **Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP)**, where the agents must optimize their policies while ensuring that certain safety thresholds are not violated.
   - The constraints are enforced using **Lagrangian optimization**, which transforms the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one by introducing Lagrange multipliers. This allows the agents to balance the trade-off between maximizing rewards and satisfying safety constraints.

3. **Lagrangian Optimization**:
   - MAPPO-L uses Lagrangian optimization to handle the safety constraints. The Lagrangian approach introduces a dual variable (Lagrange multiplier) for each constraint, which is updated iteratively to ensure that the constraints are satisfied.
   - The Lagrangian method allows MAPPO-L to adaptively adjust the importance of the constraints during training, ensuring that the agents' policies remain safe while still optimizing for high rewards.

### Comparison with Proposed Algorithms:
- **CS-MADDPG** and **CSQ** are proposed as alternatives to MAPPO-L, with the key difference being the use of the **Stackelberg model** and **bi-level optimization**. While MAPPO-L uses a centralized critic and Lagrangian constraints, the proposed algorithms introduce a hierarchical decision-making structure where one agent (the leader) influences the actions of the other agents (followers).
- The experiments in the document show that **CS-MADDPG** and **CSQ** outperform MAPPO-L in terms of both reward and safety performance, particularly in complex and dynamic environments like autonomous driving scenarios.

### Summary:
Yes, **MAPPO-L** is an example of a safe MARL algorithm that uses a **centralized critic** and **V-function constraints** to ensure safety. It employs Lagrangian optimization to handle safety constraints and is designed to work in multi-agent settings. However, the proposed **CS-MADDPG** and **CSQ** algorithms in the document offer improved performance by leveraging the Stackelberg model and bi-level optimization, which provide better coordination and safety guarantees in complex environments.

In the context of **MAPPO-L** (Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrangian constraints), the **V-function constraints** are used to ensure that the agents' policies adhere to safety requirements. These constraints are typically formulated as part of a **Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP)**, where the agents must optimize their policies while ensuring that certain safety thresholds are not violated. Below is a detailed explanation of how the **V-function constraints** are set and implemented in MAPPO-L:

---

### 1. **Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) Framework**:
   - In a CMDP, the goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected cumulative cost (related to safety) remains below a predefined threshold.
   - The optimization problem is formulated as:
     \[
     \max_{\pi} J(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t \right]
     \]
     subject to:
     \[
     G(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t c_t \right] \leq d,
     \]
     where:
     - \( J(\pi) \) is the expected cumulative reward under policy \( \pi \).
     - \( G(\pi) \) is the expected cumulative cost under policy \( \pi \).
     - \( c_t \) is the cost at time \( t \), which represents the safety violation (e.g., collision risk).
     - \( d \) is the safety threshold (maximum allowable cumulative cost).

---

### 2. **V-function Constraints**:
   - The **V-function** (value function) in reinforcement learning represents the expected cumulative reward (or cost) from a given state under a policy.
   - In MAPPO-L, the **V-function constraints** are used to enforce safety by ensuring that the expected cumulative cost does not exceed the safety threshold \( d \).
   - The **cost value function** \( V^c(s) \) is defined as:
     \[
     V^c(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t c_t \mid s_0 = s \right],
     \]
     where \( s \) is the state, and \( c_t \) is the cost at time \( t \).

   - The safety constraint is then expressed in terms of the cost value function:
     \[
     V^c(s) \leq d \quad \forall s.
     \]

---

### 3. **Lagrangian Optimization**:
   - To handle the safety constraints, MAPPO-L uses **Lagrangian optimization**, which transforms the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one by introducing Lagrange multipliers.
   - The Lagrangian function \( \mathcal{L}(\pi, \lambda) \) is defined as:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}(\pi, \lambda) = J(\pi) - \lambda \left( G(\pi) - d \right),
     \]
     where \( \lambda \) is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the safety constraint.

   - The goal is to solve the following min-max problem:
     \[
     \max_{\pi} \min_{\lambda \geq 0} \mathcal{L}(\pi, \lambda).
     \]

   - The Lagrange multiplier \( \lambda \) is updated iteratively to ensure that the safety constraint is satisfied. If the constraint is violated (i.e., \( G(\pi) > d \)), \( \lambda \) is increased to penalize the violation more heavily. If the constraint is satisfied, \( \lambda \) is decreased.

---

### 4. **Implementation in MAPPO-L**:
   - **Centralized Critic**: MAPPO-L uses a centralized critic to estimate both the reward value function \( V(s) \) and the cost value function \( V^c(s) \). The centralized critic has access to the global state and the actions of all agents, allowing it to better coordinate and optimize the policies of the agents.
   - **Policy Optimization**: The policy \( \pi \) is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which ensures stable and efficient policy updates. The policy update is guided by the Lagrangian function \( \mathcal{L}(\pi, \lambda) \), which balances the trade-off between maximizing rewards and satisfying safety constraints.
   - **Lagrange Multiplier Update**: The Lagrange multiplier \( \lambda \) is updated using gradient ascent on the Lagrangian function:
     \[
     \lambda \leftarrow \lambda + \alpha_\lambda \left( G(\pi) - d \right),
     \]
     where \( \alpha_\lambda \) is the learning rate for the Lagrange multiplier.

---

### 5. **Practical Steps in MAPPO-L**:
   - **Step 1**: Collect trajectories by executing the current policy \( \pi \) in the environment. For each trajectory, compute the cumulative reward \( J(\pi) \) and the cumulative cost \( G(\pi) \).
   - **Step 2**: Use the centralized critic to estimate the reward value function \( V(s) \) and the cost value function \( V^c(s) \).
   - **Step 3**: Update the policy \( \pi \) using PPO, with the objective function modified to include the Lagrangian term:
     \[
     \max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t \right] - \lambda \left( \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t c_t \right] - d \right).
     \]
   - **Step 4**: Update the Lagrange multiplier \( \lambda \) based on the constraint violation:
     \[
     \lambda \leftarrow \lambda + \alpha_\lambda \left( G(\pi) - d \right).
     \]

---

### Summary:
In **MAPPO-L**, the **V-function constraints** are implemented by defining a cost value function \( V^c(s) \) that represents the expected cumulative cost under the policy. The safety constraint \( V^c(s) \leq d \) is enforced using **Lagrangian optimization**, where a Lagrange multiplier \( \lambda \) is introduced to balance the trade-off between maximizing rewards and satisfying safety constraints. The centralized critic estimates both the reward and cost value functions, and the policy is optimized using PPO with the Lagrangian objective. This approach ensures that the agents' policies remain safe while still optimizing for high rewards.
