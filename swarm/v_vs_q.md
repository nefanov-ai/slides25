In **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** for **Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL)**, the **Q-function** and **V-function** play crucial roles in ensuring both performance and safety. Constraining these functions is a common approach to enforce safety constraints. Here's a breakdown of their roles and how they can be constrained:

---

### **1. Q-function vs. V-function in PPO**
- **Q-function (Q(s, a))**: Represents the expected cumulative reward (or cost) when taking action \(a\) in state \(s\) and following the policy thereafter.
- **V-function (V(s))**: Represents the expected cumulative reward (or cost) from state \(s\) when following the policy.

In Safe RL, the Q-function is often used to evaluate the safety of specific actions, while the V-function evaluates the safety of states under the current policy.

---

### **2. Constraining Q-function and V-function for Safety**
To ensure safety, constraints are applied to the Q-function or V-function, typically in the form of **cost functions** or **safety thresholds**. Here's how they can be constrained:

#### **a. Constraining the Q-function**
- **Purpose**: Ensure that actions taken in a given state do not violate safety constraints.
- **Approach**:
  - Define a **cost function** \(C(s, a)\) that quantifies the risk or safety violation of taking action \(a\) in state \(s\).
  - Use the Q-function for the cost, \(Q_C(s, a)\), to estimate the expected cumulative cost of taking action \(a\) in state \(s\).
  - Constrain the policy to ensure that \(Q_C(s, a) \leq \text{safety threshold}\).

- **Implementation**:
  - Modify the PPO objective to include a penalty or constraint on \(Q_C(s, a)\).
  - Use **Lagrangian multipliers** or **barrier functions** to enforce the constraint.

#### **b. Constraining the V-function**
- **Purpose**: Ensure that the overall policy does not lead to unsafe states.
- **Approach**:
  - Define a **cost function** \(C(s)\) that quantifies the risk or safety violation of being in state \(s\).
  - Use the V-function for the cost, \(V_C(s)\), to estimate the expected cumulative cost of being in state \(s\).
  - Constrain the policy to ensure that \(V_C(s) \leq \text{safety threshold}\).

- **Implementation**:
  - Add a constraint on \(V_C(s)\) to the PPO objective.
  - Use **trust-region methods** or **projection-based approaches** to ensure the policy remains within safe regions.

---

### **3. Practical Considerations**
- **Trade-off between Performance and Safety**: Constraining the Q-function or V-function can lead to a trade-off between maximizing rewards and satisfying safety constraints. Techniques like **constrained policy optimization (CPO)** or **Lagrangian-based methods** can help balance this trade-off.
- **Estimation of Q and V**: Accurate estimation of \(Q_C(s, a)\) and \(V_C(s)\) is critical. Use separate neural networks or critics to estimate these functions.
- **Adaptive Constraints**: Use adaptive methods to adjust safety thresholds dynamically based on the agent's performance and risk tolerance.

---

### **4. Example: Constrained PPO with Q-function**
In a constrained PPO setup, the objective might look like:
\[
\text{Objective} = \mathbb{E} \left[ \text{Advantage}(s, a) \right] - \lambda \cdot \max(0, Q_C(s, a) - \text{threshold}),
\]
where:
- \(\text{Advantage}(s, a)\) is the standard PPO advantage function.
- \(\lambda\) is a Lagrange multiplier for the safety constraint.

---

### **5. Summary**
- **Q-function**: Used to constrain actions to ensure they are safe.
- **V-function**: Used to constrain states to ensure the overall policy is safe.
- **Techniques**: Lagrangian multipliers, trust-region methods, and barrier functions are commonly used to enforce constraints.
- 

---


The choice between constraining the **Q-function** or **V-function** in **Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL)** depends on the specific problem, the nature of the safety constraints, and the trade-offs between performance and computational complexity. Here's a detailed comparison to help determine which approach is more **performance-effective**:

---

### **1. Constraining the Q-function**
#### **Advantages**:
- **Fine-grained control**: Constraining the Q-function allows for direct control over the safety of individual actions in specific states. This is particularly useful when safety constraints are action-dependent.
- **Early intervention**: By evaluating the safety of actions before they are taken, the agent can avoid unsafe actions proactively.
- **Better for sparse constraints**: If safety violations are rare but critical, constraining the Q-function can help detect and avoid these rare events more effectively.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Higher computational cost**: Estimating \(Q_C(s, a)\) for all actions in all states can be computationally expensive, especially in high-dimensional action spaces.
- **Harder to optimize**: Constraining the Q-function may lead to a more complex optimization problem, as the policy must satisfy safety constraints for every action.

#### **When to use**:
- When safety constraints are action-dependent.
- When the action space is relatively small or manageable.
- When early detection and avoidance of unsafe actions are critical.

---

### **2. Constraining the V-function**
#### **Advantages**:
- **Lower computational cost**: Estimating \(V_C(s)\) is generally less expensive than estimating \(Q_C(s, a)\), as it does not require evaluating all possible actions.
- **Easier optimization**: Constraining the V-function simplifies the optimization problem, as it focuses on the overall safety of states rather than individual actions.
- **Better for state-dependent constraints**: If safety constraints are primarily state-dependent (e.g., avoiding certain regions of the state space), constraining the V-function is more natural.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Less fine-grained control**: The V-function does not provide direct control over the safety of individual actions, which may lead to suboptimal policies in action-dependent safety scenarios.
- **Delayed intervention**: The agent may only detect safety violations after reaching an unsafe state, rather than avoiding unsafe actions proactively.

#### **When to use**:
- When safety constraints are state-dependent.
- When the action space is large or continuous.
- When computational efficiency is a priority.

---

### **3. Performance-Effectiveness Comparison**
| **Aspect**               | **Constraining Q-function**                     | **Constraining V-function**                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Granularity**          | Fine-grained (action-level)                    | Coarse-grained (state-level)                |
| **Computational Cost**   | Higher (evaluates all actions)                 | Lower (evaluates states only)               |
| **Optimization Difficulty** | Harder (more constraints)                    | Easier (fewer constraints)                  |
| **Proactive Safety**     | Better (avoids unsafe actions early)           | Worse (detects unsafe states later)         |
| **Suitable for**         | Action-dependent constraints, small action spaces | State-dependent constraints, large action spaces |

---

### **4. Which is More Performance-Effective?**
- **Constraining the Q-function** is more performance-effective when:
  - Safety constraints are action-dependent.
  - The action space is small or manageable.
  - Proactive avoidance of unsafe actions is critical.

- **Constraining the V-function** is more performance-effective when:
  - Safety constraints are state-dependent.
  - The action space is large or continuous.
  - Computational efficiency is a priority.

---

### **5. Hybrid Approaches**
In many cases, a **hybrid approach** that combines both Q-function and V-function constraints can be the most performance-effective. For example:
- Use the **Q-function** to avoid unsafe actions in critical states.
- Use the **V-function** to ensure the overall policy remains safe in the long term.

This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methods while mitigating their weaknesses.

---

### **6. Practical Recommendations**
- **Start with V-function constraints**: If you're unsure which method to use, start with V-function constraints due to their lower computational cost and easier optimization.
- **Add Q-function constraints if needed**: If the agent still violates safety constraints, consider adding Q-function constraints for fine-grained control.
- **Use adaptive methods**: Implement adaptive safety thresholds or Lagrangian multipliers to dynamically balance performance and safety.

By carefully selecting the appropriate constraint method (or combining both), you can achieve a performance-effective solution for Safe RL using PPO.

---



By carefully constraining the Q-function and V-function, PPO can be adapted for Safe RL, ensuring that the agent learns policies that are both high-performing and safe.


---

When it comes to **theoretical guarantees of safety** in **Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL)**, the choice between constraining the **Q-function** and **V-function** depends on the mathematical framework and assumptions used. Both approaches can provide safety guarantees, but they do so under different conditions and theoretical foundations. Below, I explain the theoretical safety guarantees for each approach and highlight their differences.

---

### **1. Constraining the Q-function**
#### **Theoretical Basis**:
- The Q-function represents the expected cumulative cost (or reward) of taking an action \(a\) in state \(s\) and following the policy thereafter.
- By constraining the Q-function for a **cost function** \(Q_C(s, a)\), we can ensure that the expected cumulative cost of any action \(a\) in state \(s\) does not exceed a safety threshold.

#### **Safety Guarantee**:
- If \(Q_C(s, a) \leq \text{threshold}\) for all \((s, a)\), then the policy is guaranteed to satisfy the safety constraint **at every step**.
- This provides **action-level safety**, meaning the agent avoids taking unsafe actions in any state.

#### **Theorems and Frameworks**:
- **Constrained MDPs (CMDPs)**: In CMDPs, safety constraints are often expressed as bounds on the expected cumulative cost. Constraining the Q-function directly enforces these bounds.
- **Lyapunov Functions**: In some frameworks, the Q-function can be used as a Lyapunov function to prove stability and safety. If \(Q_C(s, a)\) is bounded, the system remains within a safe region.

#### **Limitations**:
- The guarantee relies on accurate estimation of \(Q_C(s, a)\). In practice, approximation errors can weaken the guarantee.
- The constraint must hold for all \((s, a)\), which can be computationally expensive to enforce.

---

### **2. Constraining the V-function**
#### **Theoretical Basis**:
- The V-function represents the expected cumulative cost (or reward) of being in state \(s\) and following the policy thereafter.
- By constraining the V-function for a **cost function** \(V_C(s)\), we can ensure that the expected cumulative cost of being in any state \(s\) does not exceed a safety threshold.

#### **Safety Guarantee**:
- If \(V_C(s) \leq \text{threshold}\) for all \(s\), then the policy is guaranteed to satisfy the safety constraint **in expectation over trajectories**.
- This provides **state-level safety**, meaning the agent avoids unsafe states on average.

#### **Theorems and Frameworks**:
- **Constrained MDPs (CMDPs)**: In CMDPs, constraints on the V-function enforce bounds on the expected cumulative cost over trajectories.
- **Risk-Sensitive RL**: Constraining the V-function can be used to enforce risk-sensitive safety criteria, such as CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) or probabilistic safety guarantees.

#### **Limitations**:
- The guarantee is in expectation, meaning there may still be rare violations of safety constraints.
- The constraint must hold for all states, which can be challenging in large or continuous state spaces.

---

### **3. Theoretical Comparison**
| **Aspect**               | **Constraining Q-function**                     | **Constraining V-function**                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Type of Guarantee**    | Action-level safety (per-step constraint)      | State-level safety (trajectory-level constraint) |
| **Mathematical Framework** | Constrained MDPs, Lyapunov functions          | Constrained MDPs, Risk-Sensitive RL         |
| **Strength of Guarantee** | Stronger (avoids unsafe actions at every step) | Weaker (ensures safety in expectation)      |
| **Practical Challenges**  | Requires accurate \(Q_C(s, a)\) estimation    | Requires accurate \(V_C(s)\) estimation     |

---

### **4. Which Approach Theoretically Provides Safety?**
- **Constraining the Q-function** provides stronger theoretical safety guarantees because it ensures that **no unsafe actions are taken at any step**. This is particularly useful in safety-critical applications where even a single unsafe action can lead to catastrophic outcomes.
- **Constraining the V-function** provides weaker guarantees because it ensures safety **in expectation over trajectories**. This may be sufficient in applications where rare safety violations are acceptable.

---

### **5. Hybrid Approaches for Stronger Guarantees**
In practice, a **hybrid approach** that combines both Q-function and V-function constraints can provide stronger theoretical guarantees:
- Use the **Q-function** to enforce per-step safety constraints.
- Use the **V-function** to enforce long-term safety constraints.

This combination ensures both immediate and long-term safety, leveraging the strengths of both approaches.

---

### **6. Key Takeaways**
- **Q-function constraints** provide stronger theoretical safety guarantees at the action level.
- **V-function constraints** provide weaker guarantees at the state level but are computationally more efficient.
- For the strongest theoretical guarantees, consider a **hybrid approach** that combines both methods.
- 

---

To provide a **theorem on V-function constraints** in the context of **Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL)**, we can frame the problem within the **Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP)** framework. The theorem will establish conditions under which constraining the V-function ensures safety in terms of expected cumulative costs.

---

### **Theorem: Safety Guarantee via V-function Constraints**

#### **Setup**:
- Let \( \mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, r, c, \gamma) \) be a **Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP)**, where:
  - \( \mathcal{S} \): State space.
  - \( \mathcal{A} \): Action space.
  - \( P \): Transition dynamics, \( P(s' | s, a) \).
  - \( r \): Reward function, \( r(s, a) \).
  - \( c \): Cost function, \( c(s, a) \), representing the safety violation at each step.
  - \( \gamma \): Discount factor, \( \gamma \in [0, 1) \).
- Let \( V_C^\pi(s) \) be the **cost value function** (V-function for costs) under policy \( \pi \), defined as:
  \[
  V_C^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t c(s_t, a_t) \,\bigg|\, s_0 = s, a_t \sim \pi(\cdot | s_t) \right].
  \]
- Let \( \tau \) be a **safety threshold**, such that the expected cumulative cost must satisfy \( V_C^\pi(s) \leq \tau \) for all \( s \in \mathcal{S} \).

---

#### **Theorem**:
If a policy \( \pi \) satisfies:
\[
V_C^\pi(s) \leq \tau \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S},
\]
then the expected cumulative cost of \( \pi \) starting from any state \( s \) is bounded by \( \tau \). This ensures that the policy \( \pi \) is **safe** in the sense that it satisfies the safety constraint in expectation.

---

#### **Proof**:
1. **Definition of \( V_C^\pi(s) \)**:
   By definition, \( V_C^\pi(s) \) represents the expected cumulative cost of following policy \( \pi \) starting from state \( s \):
   \[
   V_C^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t c(s_t, a_t) \,\bigg|\, s_0 = s, a_t \sim \pi(\cdot | s_t) \right].
   \]

2. **Constraint Satisfaction**:
   If \( V_C^\pi(s) \leq \tau \) for all \( s \in \mathcal{S} \), then:
   \[
   \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t c(s_t, a_t) \,\bigg|\, s_0 = s, a_t \sim \pi(\cdot | s_t) \right] \leq \tau \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}.
   \]
   This means that the expected cumulative cost of \( \pi \) is bounded by \( \tau \) for any starting state \( s \).

3. **Implication for Safety**:
   Since \( V_C^\pi(s) \leq \tau \) for all \( s \), the policy \( \pi \) ensures that the expected cumulative cost (e.g., safety violations) over trajectories is bounded by \( \tau \). This provides a **probabilistic safety guarantee** in expectation.

---

#### **Remarks**:
1. **Interpretation**:
   - The theorem guarantees that the **expected cumulative cost** of the policy \( \pi \) is bounded by \( \tau \).
   - This is a **weaker guarantee** than per-step safety (e.g., constraining the Q-function), as it allows for rare safety violations as long as the expected cost remains within the threshold.

2. **Practical Implications**:
   - To enforce this constraint in practice, one can use **Lagrangian methods** or **trust-region optimization** to ensure \( V_C^\pi(s) \leq \tau \) during policy optimization.
   - The constraint must hold for all states \( s \in \mathcal{S} \), which can be challenging in large or continuous state spaces. Approximation methods (e.g., using neural networks) are often used to estimate \( V_C^\pi(s) \).

3. **Extensions**:
   - The theorem can be extended to **finite-horizon settings** by replacing the infinite sum with a finite sum over a horizon \( T \).
   - It can also be generalized to **risk-sensitive constraints** (e.g., CVaR or chance constraints) by modifying the definition of \( V_C^\pi(s) \).

---

### **Example Application**
In **Safe RL**, this theorem can be used to design algorithms that enforce safety constraints via the V-function. For instance:
1. Define a cost function \( c(s, a) \) that quantifies safety violations.
2. Train a policy \( \pi \) to maximize reward while ensuring \( V_C^\pi(s) \leq \tau \) for all \( s \).
3. Use a **Lagrangian dual** to incorporate the constraint into the optimization objective:
   \[
   \mathcal{L}(\pi, \lambda) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t) \right] - \lambda \left( V_C^\pi(s) - \tau \right),
   \]
   where \( \lambda \) is the Lagrange multiplier.

---

### **Conclusion**
The theorem provides a **theoretical foundation** for ensuring safety in Safe RL by constraining the V-function. While it offers a probabilistic safety guarantee in expectation, it is important to note that this guarantee is weaker than per-step safety (e.g., Q-function constraints). However, it is often more computationally tractable and can be combined with other methods (e.g., Q-function constraints) to achieve stronger safety guarantees.

---


The **theorem on V-function constraints** and its application to **Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL)** is not tied to a single specific article but is instead a fundamental concept that appears in various forms across the literature on **Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs)** and **Safe RL**.

Let’s design an example of a **Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL)** task for **drone control** using **V-function constraints**. In this scenario, the drone must navigate to a target location while avoiding obstacles and staying within a safe region. The safety constraint is enforced by limiting the expected cumulative cost (e.g., proximity to obstacles or dangerous areas).

---

### **Task Setting: Safe Drone Navigation**

#### **1. Environment Setup**
- **State Space (\( \mathcal{S} \))**:
  - The drone’s position \((x, y, z)\) in 3D space.
  - The drone’s velocity \((v_x, v_y, v_z)\).
  - Positions of obstacles and the target location.
  - Example: \( s = (x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z, \text{obstacle positions}, \text{target position}) \).

- **Action Space (\( \mathcal{A} \))**:
  - The drone’s thrust and orientation changes.
  - Example: \( a = (\Delta v_x, \Delta v_y, \Delta v_z) \).

- **Dynamics**:
  - The drone moves according to simplified physics:
    \[
    x_{t+1} = x_t + v_x \Delta t, \quad y_{t+1} = y_t + v_y \Delta t, \quad z_{t+1} = z_t + v_z \Delta t,
    \]
    where \( \Delta t \) is the time step.

- **Reward Function (\( r(s, a) \))**:
  - Positive reward for reaching the target.
  - Negative reward for crashing into obstacles or leaving the safe region.
  - Example:
    \[
    r(s, a) = \begin{cases}
    +100 & \text{if the drone reaches the target}, \\
    -100 & \text{if the drone crashes}, \\
    -\| \text{position} - \text{target} \| & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
    \]

- **Cost Function (\( c(s, a) \))**:
  - The cost represents safety violations, such as proximity to obstacles or leaving the safe region.
  - Example:
    \[
    c(s, a) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if the drone is too close to an obstacle}, \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
    \]

---

#### **2. Safety Constraint**
The drone must ensure that the **expected cumulative cost** (e.g., time spent near obstacles) does not exceed a safety threshold \( \tau \). This is enforced by constraining the **cost V-function** \( V_C^\pi(s) \):
\[
V_C^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t c(s_t, a_t) \,\bigg|\, s_0 = s, a_t \sim \pi(\cdot | s_t) \right] \leq \tau.
\]

---

#### **3. Safe RL Algorithm**
We use a **Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO)** approach to solve this problem. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. **Policy Evaluation**:
   - Estimate the cost V-function \( V_C^\pi(s) \) using a neural network or other function approximator.
   - Update \( V_C^\pi(s) \) using the Bellman equation:
     \[
     V_C^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi(\cdot | s)} \left[ c(s, a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim P(\cdot | s, a)} \left[ V_C^\pi(s') \right] \right].
     \]

2. **Policy Improvement**:
   - Maximize the reward objective while ensuring the safety constraint:
     \[
     \max_\pi \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t) \right],
     \]
     subject to:
     \[
     V_C^\pi(s) \leq \tau \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S}.
     \]

3. **Lagrangian Method**:
   - Use a Lagrangian multiplier \( \lambda \) to incorporate the constraint into the objective:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}(\pi, \lambda) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t) \right] - \lambda \left( V_C^\pi(s) - \tau \right).
     \]
   - Optimize \( \pi \) and \( \lambda \) iteratively.

---

#### **4. Example Simulation**
- **Initial State**: The drone starts at \((0, 0, 0)\) with zero velocity.
- **Target Location**: \((10, 10, 5)\).
- **Obstacles**: Two obstacles at \((3, 3, 2)\) and \((7, 7, 4)\).
- **Safety Threshold**: \( \tau = 0.1 \) (the drone should spend minimal time near obstacles).

- **Training**:
  - The drone learns to navigate to the target while avoiding obstacles.
  - The cost V-function \( V_C^\pi(s) \) is constrained to ensure safety.

- **Result**:
  - The drone reaches the target while staying within the safety threshold \( \tau \).

---

#### **5. Key Takeaways**
- The **cost V-function** \( V_C^\pi(s) \) is used to enforce safety constraints by limiting the expected cumulative cost.
- The **CPO algorithm** optimizes the policy to maximize reward while satisfying the safety constraint.
- This approach ensures that the drone avoids obstacles and stays within the safe region in expectation.

---

In the **swarm drone control task** described above, **obstacles are not explicitly included** in the setup. However, they can easily be incorporated into the task to make it more realistic and challenging. Below, I’ll extend the task to include **static or dynamic obstacles** and explain how the safety constraints and algorithms can be adapted to handle them.

---

### **Extended Task Setting: Safe Swarm Drone Navigation with Obstacles**

#### **1. Environment Setup (Including Obstacles)**
- **Number of Drones**: \( N \) drones in the swarm.
- **Obstacles**:
  - \( M \) static or dynamic obstacles in the environment.
  - Each obstacle has a position \((x_k, y_k, z_k)\) and a radius \( r_k \) (for simplicity, assume spherical obstacles).

- **State Space (\( \mathcal{S} \))**:
  - Each drone’s state includes its position \((x_i, y_i, z_i)\), velocity \((v_{x_i}, v_{y_i}, v_{z_i})\), and information about obstacles.
  - Example for drone \( i \):
    \[
    s_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i, v_{x_i}, v_{y_i}, v_{z_i}, \text{positions of other drones}, \text{positions and radii of obstacles}, \text{target position}).
    \]
  - The global state \( S \) is the concatenation of all individual drone states:
    \[
    S = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_N).
    \]

- **Action Space (\( \mathcal{A} \))**:
  - Each drone’s action is its thrust and orientation changes.
  - Example for drone \( i \):
    \[
    a_i = (\Delta v_{x_i}, \Delta v_{y_i}, \Delta v_{z_i}).
    \]
  - The global action \( A \) is the concatenation of all individual drone actions:
    \[
    A = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N).
    \]

- **Dynamics**:
  - Each drone moves according to simplified physics:
    \[
    x_{i,t+1} = x_{i,t} + v_{x_i} \Delta t, \quad y_{i,t+1} = y_{i,t} + v_{y_i} \Delta t, \quad z_{i,t+1} = z_{i,t} + v_{z_i} \Delta t.
    \]
  - Obstacles can be static or dynamic (e.g., moving with predefined trajectories).

---

#### **2. Reward Function (\( r(S, A) \))**:
- **Positive reward** for reaching the target.
- **Negative reward** for collisions with obstacles or other drones, or for leaving the safe region.
- Example for drone \( i \):
  \[
  r_i(s_i, a_i) = \begin{cases}
  +100 & \text{if drone } i \text{ reaches the target}, \\
  -100 & \text{if drone } i \text{ crashes into an obstacle or another drone}, \\
  -\| \text{position}_i - \text{target} \| & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
  \]
- The global reward \( R \) is the sum of individual rewards:
  \[
  R(S, A) = \sum_{i=1}^N r_i(s_i, a_i).
  \]

---

#### **3. Cost Function (\( c(S, A) \))**:
The cost function now includes two components:
1. **Collision Avoidance Between Drones**:
   - Drones must maintain a minimum safe distance \( d_{\text{safe}} \) from each other.
   - Example for drone \( i \):
     \[
     c_{i,\text{drones}}(s_i, a_i) = \begin{cases}
     1 & \text{if } \min_{j \neq i} \| \text{position}_i - \text{position}_j \| < d_{\text{safe}}, \\
     0 & \text{otherwise}.
     \end{cases}
     \]

2. **Collision Avoidance with Obstacles**:
   - Drones must avoid getting too close to obstacles.
   - Example for drone \( i \):
     \[
     c_{i,\text{obstacles}}(s_i, a_i) = \begin{cases}
     1 & \text{if } \min_{k} \| \text{position}_i - \text{obstacle}_k \| < r_k + d_{\text{safe}}}, \\
     0 & \text{otherwise}.
     \end{cases}
     \]
   - Here, \( r_k \) is the radius of obstacle \( k \), and \( d_{\text{safe}}} \) is the minimum safe distance from obstacles.

- The **global cost** \( C \) is the sum of individual costs for all drones:
  \[
  C(S, A) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( c_{i,\text{drones}}(s_i, a_i) + c_{i,\text{obstacles}}(s_i, a_i) \right).
  \]

---

#### **4. Safety Constraint**
The swarm must ensure that the **expected cumulative cost** (e.g., time spent with drones too close to each other or to obstacles) does not exceed a safety threshold \( \tau \). This is enforced by constraining the **cost V-function** \( V_C^\pi(S) \):
\[
V_C^\pi(S) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t C(S_t, A_t) \,\bigg|\, S_0 = S, A_t \sim \pi(\cdot | S_t) \right] \leq \tau.
\]

---

#### **5. Multi-Agent Safe RL Algorithm (MAPPO with Constraints)**
The algorithm remains the same as before, but now the cost function \( C(S, A) \) includes both drone-drone and drone-obstacle collision avoidance.

1. **Policy Evaluation**:
   - Estimate the cost V-function \( V_C^\pi(S) \) using a centralized critic.
   - Update \( V_C^\pi(S) \) using the Bellman equation:
     \[
     V_C^\pi(S) = \mathbb{E}_{A \sim \pi(\cdot | S)} \left[ C(S, A) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{S' \sim P(\cdot | S, A)} \left[ V_C^\pi(S') \right] \right].
     \]

2. **Policy Improvement**:
   - Maximize the reward objective while ensuring the safety constraint:
     \[
     \max_\pi \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R(S_t, A_t) \right],
     \]
     subject to:
     \[
     V_C^\pi(S) \leq \tau \quad \forall S \in \mathcal{S}.
     \]

3. **Lagrangian Method**:
   - Use a Lagrangian multiplier \( \lambda \) to incorporate the constraint into the objective:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}(\pi, \lambda) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R(S_t, A_t) \right] - \lambda \left( V_C^\pi(S) - \tau \right).
     \]
   - Optimize \( \pi \) and \( \lambda \) iteratively.

#### **6. Example Simulation**
- **Number of Drones**: \( N = 5 \).
- **Obstacles**: \( M = 3 \) static obstacles with positions \((3, 3, 2)\), \((7, 7, 4)\), and \((5, 5, 3)\), each with radius \( r_k = 1 \).
- **Initial State**: All drones start at random positions within a bounded region.
- **Target Location**: A common target at \((10, 10, 5)\).
- **Safety Distance**: \( d_{\text{safe}} = 2 \) meters (for both drones and obstacles).
- **Safety Threshold**: \( \tau = 0.1 \).

- **Training**:
  - The swarm learns to navigate to the target while avoiding collisions with obstacles and other drones.
  - The cost V-function \( V_C^\pi(S) \) is constrained to ensure safety.

- **Result**:
  - The swarm reaches the target while maintaining safe distances from obstacles and other drones.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways**
- **Obstacles** are incorporated into the task by extending the state space and cost function.
- The **cost V-function** \( V_C^\pi(S) \) now includes both drone-drone and drone-obstacle collision avoidance.
- **MAPPO** with safety constraints ensures that the swarm avoids collisions and maintains safe distances in expectation.
